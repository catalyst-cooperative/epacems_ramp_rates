component_id:    The ID corresponding to the connected subcomponents (EPA units and EIA generators) that have been aggregated together. Note that these IDs are regenerated each time, so are subject to change between runs.
sum_of_max_gross_load_mw:    Empirical capacity by summing the max load of each individual EPA timeseries. This method may overestimate capacity.
max_of_sum_gross_load_mw:    Empirical capacity by taking the max after summing the individual EPA timeseries into a component-level timeseries. This is the preferred capacity estimate.
max_ramp:    The highest positive ramp rate of a component-level timeseries after filtering out cold starts
min_ramp:    The lowest negative ramp rate of a component-level timeseries after filtering out cold starts
idxmax_ramp:    The timestamp of max_ramp
idxmin_ramp:    The timestamp of min_ramp
max_abs_ramp:    The largest magnitude ramp rate of a component-level timeseries after filtering out cold starts
idxmax_abs_ramp:    The timestamp of max_abs_ramp
EIA_UNIT_TYPE:    The set of EIA technology types found within this component
capacity_CAMD:    Nameplate capacity as reported by CAMD, aggregated to the component level
capacity_EIA:    Nameplate capacity as reported by EIA, aggregated to the component level
simple_CAMD_FUEL_TYPE_via_capacity:    Simplified fuel type of component according the CAMD category. See src.build_features.CAMD_FUEL_MAP for details. When there are multiple (rare), the one with the highest corresponding CAMD nameplate capacity is chosen.
simple_EIA_FUEL_TYPE_via_capacity:    Fuel type of component according the EIA category. See src.build_features.EIA_FUEL_MAP for details. When there are multiple (rare), the one with the highest corresponding EIA nameplate capacity is chosen.
simple_EIA_UNIT_TYPE:    EIA_UNIT_TYPE mapped to simple categories. See src.build_features.TECH_TYPE_MAP for details
ramp_factor_CAMD:    max_abs_ramp divided by capacity_CAMD
ramp_factor_EIA:    max_abs_ramp divided by capacity_EIA
ramp_factor_sum_max:    max_abs_ramp divided by sum_of_max_gross_load_mw
ramp_factor_max_sum:    max_abs_ramp divided by max_of_sum_gross_load_mw. This is the preferred estimate.


Notes:
Ramps are defined between timestamps; the idxmax/idxmin timestamps mark the END of the ramp event.
Nameplate capacity can vary substantially between EIA and EPA. The preferred capacity is the empirical estimate max_of_sum_gross_load_mw
