## Contents:
* output_2015-2019.csv: results of analysis of CEMS data from 2015-2019, inclusive.
* output_2015-2019_crosswalk_with_IDs.csv: EPA crosswalk with `component_id` column added. Use this to inspect which combustors/generators are grouped together into the same component. Note that component_id may change with different inputs (even different ordering) so we advise keeping these output files together.

These outputs were generated by running:

`calc_ramps ./results/output_2015-2019.csv --first-year 2015 --last-year 2019 --states 'all'`

## Notes
* Ramps are defined between timestamps; the idxmax/idxmin timestamps mark the *end* of the ramp event.
* Nameplate capacity can vary substantially between EIA and EPA. The preferred capacity is the empirical estimate max_of_sum_gross_load_mw
* Some CEMS units report steam production instead of electical generation. This is not yet accounted for in the analysis - their ramp rates and empirical capacity estimates are 0.0 in the output table.
