epacems_ramp_rates
==============================

Characterization of power plant ramp rates using hourly EPA CEMS data

Outline of work and current progress:

- [X] Plan analysis path and do initial exploration of ramp rates
- [ ] Identify and select 'normal' plant operations
  - [X] Identify startup and shutdown events
  - [X] Analyze ramp rates vs proximity to startups/shutdowns
- [ ] Check if hourly resolution is sufficient to calculate ramp rates
  - [X] For peakers, check single-point spikes (unresolveable peaks).
  - [ ] For 'baseload', check that ramp rates are smaller than operating band
- [ ] Idenfify maximum per-unit hourly load change
- [X] Join EPA emissions units with EIA generation units
- [ ] Anomaly detection and imputation
- [ ] Ramp rate sensitivity analysis
- [ ] Finalize module or script to calculate ramp rates
